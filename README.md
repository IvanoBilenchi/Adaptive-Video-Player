## Adaptive Video Player

Project for my *Control Methods for Computer Networks* exam.

It's an HLS player which supports manual selection for the quality of adaptive streams (normally not possible via Apple APIs) by exploiting a specialized, opaque local HTTP proxy. Granted, it's kind of an hack and it will most likely break many kinds of streams, but hey, it works.

`carthage update` and have fun.
